## Misc MUD + Admin
* Github classroom teams is broken at the moment. See Canvas for our PS3 workaround ("PS3 and PS4 Github classroom patch"). Hope to have it fixed for remaining problem sets.
* You will have to create your own Github repo for PS3. See Canvas announcement from yesterday ("Clarification...")
* What is a good set of reference material to use after class? Textbooks!
* What are expectations for calendar/time allocation?
    * Weekly PS until Thanksgiving (last one due 11/16)
    * Final project akin to an extended, less structured PS (present in class 12/2-12/5). All materials in by 12/6.
    * Reading period: study for final (12/12)

<!-- - “I still have no clue why we are learning git” -->
- How do I handle merge conflicts? *covered today*
-  [Command line cheatsheet (link)](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/command-line-cheat-sheet/): `pwd`, `cd`, etc...
- Tech setup
\vspace{2ex}
    - By now, you should have command line git installed 
    - If you want to get ahead for the do-pair-share, fork  [https://github.com/uchicago-harris-dap/merge_example (link)](https://github.com/uchicago-harris-dap/merge_example) on github.com and then clone the repo to your computer

## Getting ahead of today's do-pair-share

1. On github.com, fork [https://github.com/uchicago-harris-dap/merge_example (link)](https://github.com/uchicago-harris-dap/merge_example) 
    * Importantly: *uncheck "fork main only"**
2. Clone your fork to local - can use Github Desktop for now
