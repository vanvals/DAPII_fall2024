# Introduction to data structures in geopandas (6.2)

## Geopandas roadmap

In practice, we won't be coding our geodata by hand... Instead we are going to use shapefiles!

```{python}
import geopandas as gpd
```


Roadmap

-   Vocabulary
-   File formats
-   Read in data
-   Preview data

## Define vocabulary

Vocabulary

-   A `GeoDataFrame` is basically like a `pandas.DataFrame` that contains dedicated columns for storing geometries.
    - We will start with examples with a single column and later teach you how to use more than one column
-   That column is called a `GeoSeries`. This can be any of data types (point, line, polygon) from the prior section. All of the methods you saw in the last section can also be used on a `GeoSeries`


## File format I: Shapefile

-   consists of at least three files `.shp` has feature geometrics, `.shx` has a positional index, `.dbf` has attribute information
-   Usually also have `.prj` which describes the Coordinate Reference System (CRS)
-   When you read in `map.shp` it automatically reads the rest of them as well to give you proper GeoDataFrame composed of geometry, attributes and projection.


## Coordinate Reference Systems
- Coordinate Reference System (CRS) is a combination of:
    - "Datum": origin of latitude and longitude 
    - "Project": representation of curved surface onto flat map
- Most common CRS: WGS84 (used for GPS)
- All coordinates are consistent *within* a CRS, but not always *across* CRS's
- Different CRS's suit different needs
    - optimized for local vs. global accuracy
    - different approaches to approx. shape of the earth
    - distance is measured in different units: degrees, miles, meters
- Each system is associated with a unique *EPSG code*. Searchable on [https://epsg.io](https://epsg.io)
    - (Aside: EPSG stands for European Petroleum Survey Group)
    - These codes are used to convert one CRS into another

<!-- ZZZZ here I would go to the epsg link and search up WGS84 to show that it is EPSG number 4326. https://epsg.io/4326. 
Then you can look up "Illinois" and show that there are Illinois-east and Illinois-west-specific CRS's. 
The skill they should learn is what a CRS is and how to look up the EPSG numbers so that they can transform from one CRS to another: https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/reference/api/geopandas.GeoDataFrame.to_crs.html  -->


## Reading a Shapefile `.shp`

```{python}
#in same dir:  `.shx` and `.dbf`
filepath = "data/shp/austin_pop_2019.shp"
data = gpd.read_file(filepath)
```


## File format II: GeoPackage

-   single file `.gpkg`
-   Supports both raster and vector data
-   Efficiently decodable by software, particularly in mobile devices

GeoPackage is more modern, but you will encounter shapefiles everywhere you look so good to be familiar with it.

## Reading a GeoPackage `gpkg`

```{python}
filepath = "data/austin_pop_2019.gpkg"
data = gpd.read_file(filepath)
type(data)
```




## Previewing a `GeoDataFrame`


\scriptsize
```{python}
data.head()
```

\normalsize

## Previewing a `GeoSeries`

```{python, fig-align="center" height=70%}
#| fig-height: 3
data.plot()
```

Discussion question: Why isn't it enough to just to `head()`?


<!-- ZZZ solution: because WKT isn't intellgible to you for sanity checking. But seeing an actual map is. Also, note that the WKT are not comparable to the WKT we saw in examples earlier because they're on different coordinate reference systems? -->

## Geopandas summary

-   `GeoDataFrame` and `GeoSeries` are the counterparts of `pandas.DataFrame` and `pandas.Series`
-   `.shp` and `.gpkg` are two ways of storing geo data
-   Always plot your map before you do anything else

# Geometries in geopandas (6.2)

## geometries: roadmap

-   methods applied to `GeoSeries`
-   my first choropleth

<!-- MS to GGG: fixed small typo throughout - it's "choropleth," not "chloropleth." Before I taught spatial I also could have sworn it was called chloropleth too! -->

## `GeoSeries`

```{python}
type(data["geometry"])
```

<!--PG note to self: textbook uses inconsistent syntax for extracting geometry in different places. I have made it consistent to improve clarity-->

## `head()`


\scriptsize 

```{python}
data["geometry"].head()
```

\normalsize

## calculate area (in square meters)

```{python}
data["geometry"].area
```

## add column to data frame


\scriptsize 
```{python}
#data.area is just a shorthand for data.geometry.area
data["area_km2"] = data.area / 1000000
data[['tract', 'area_km2', 'geometry']].head()
```

\normalsize

## my first choropleth

```{python}
data.plot(column="area_km2", legend=True)
```

Discussion question -- why is this a nearly useless set of colors?
<!--Usually we do choropleths based on attributes. Will do this in the next section of lecture.-->

## geometries: summary

-   can do all the same operations on a `GeoSeries` that you would do on any other polygon, like `Area`
-   `data.plot(column="var")` draws a choropleth map with shading corresponding to the highlighted variable


# Common geometric operations (6.3)

## common geometric operations: roadmap

* load and explore data
* methods
    * centroid
    * bounding box
    * buffer
    * dissolve
    * spatial join
* do-pair-share

## Austin, continued

(The textbook uses a slightly different file here, unclear why to us.)
```{python}
filepath = "data/austin_pop_density_2019.gpkg"
data = gpd.read_file(filepath)
```

## explore the data I
```{python}
data.head()
```

## explore the data II
```{python}
type(data["geometry"].values[0])
```

## explore the data III
```{python out-height = 1}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
data.plot(facecolor="none", linewidth=0.2)
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()
```

- Import `matplotlib.pyplot` to access additional plotting options (e.g., x and y labels, title)
- We turn the axis off because the WKT is not informative


## explore the data IV
```{python out-height = 1}
data.plot(column="pop_density_km2")
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()
```

- `facecolor` (or `fc` or `color`) defines a uniform color across all geometries
- whereas `columns` generates colors based on the underlying values 

## methods: centroid I

What it is: arithmetic mean position of all the points in a polygon

Sample use case: measuring distance between center of each multipolygon

```{python}
data["geometry"].centroid.head()
```

## methods: centroid II
```{python}
data.centroid.plot(markersize=1)
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()
```

## centroid example outside polygon

![](pictures/census-usa-example_zoom19.png){height="80%"}

Source: https://spatialanalysisonline.com/HTML/centroids_and_centers.htm

## aside: change active geometry

\scriptsize
```{python}
data["centroid"] = data.centroid
data.set_geometry("centroid")
data[['tract', 'centroid', 'geometry']].head()
```
\normalsize

## methods: bounding box definition

What it is: the tightest possible rectangle around a shape, capturing all of its points within this rectangle. 

Sample use case: filtering a larger spatial dataset to subset of interest

## methods: bounding box for each polygon I

```{python}
data.envelope.head()
```

## methods: bounding box for each polygon II
```{python}
data.envelope.plot()
```


## methods: bounding box for whole data I


\scriptsize
```{python}
data.total_bounds
```
\normalsize

## methods: bounding box for whole data II
Flashback to section 6.1
```{python}
from shapely import Point, Polygon
point1 = Point(data.total_bounds[0], data.total_bounds[1])
point2 = Point(data.total_bounds[2], data.total_bounds[1])
point3 = Point(data.total_bounds[2], data.total_bounds[3])
point4 = Point(data.total_bounds[0], data.total_bounds[3])
poly = Polygon([point1, point2, point3, point4])
#poly
```
- *Note*: the order in which you put these points together matters, and you'll get all sorts of interesting shapes with different orders!

<!-- PG to MS:
data.union_all().envelope should also work, but it is throwing an error for me

MS to PG: I'm also getting an error.  "AttributeError: 'GeoDataFrame' object has no attribute 'union_all'"
Very odd since there's documentation for it... https://geopandas.org/en/latest/docs/reference/api/geopandas.GeoSeries.union_all.html
-->

## methods: buffer I

What it is: shape representing all points that are less than a certain distance from the original shape

Sample use cases: 

* how many stores or parks near a neighborhood
* geometries that don't line up well (e.g. coasts)
* selecting nearby geometries

## methods: buffer II

```{python}
data.buffer(1000).plot(edgecolor="white") #1000 meters
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()
```

## methods: dissolve I

What it is: combining geometries into coarser spatial units based on some attributes. 

Sample use case: construct the geometries that you want to serve with public transit

```{python}
# Create a new column and add a constant value
data["dense"] = 0

# Filter rows with above average pop density and update the column dense
data.loc[data["pop_density_km2"] > data["pop_density_km2"].mean(), "dense"] = 1
data.dense.value_counts()
```

<!-- MS to GGG: this would be a great discussion question (if the comment was removed): what is that line of code doing? Why would this relate to the sample use described above? Answer: say the city can only serve half of the areas with public transit and wants to create a map with just those areas combined.-->

## methods: dissolve II

\scriptsize
```{python}
dissolved = data[["pop2019", "area_km2", "dense", "geometry"]].dissolve(
    by="dense", aggfunc="sum"
)
#aggregation step set index to "dense", reset to default
dissolved = dissolved.reset_index()
dissolved
```
\normalsize

- Aggregating alters the way the data is indexed and makes the grouping variable the index
- We need to reset it in order to plot, since some plotting libraries expect data to be indexed in a specific way


## methods: dissolve III
```{python}
dissolved.plot(column="dense")
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()
```

Discussion Question: What can we do to improve this map?

<!-- ZZZ: no -- the reader has no idea what purple and yellow mean. It would be better if we added a legend that indicates that purple areas are above-median in population density while yellow is below-median. -->


## methods: spatial join

Spatial join: find the closest neighbor.

```{python}
data_for_join = data[["tract", "geometry"]]
print("N tracts " + str(len(data_for_join)))
join_to_self = gpd.sjoin_nearest(
    data_for_join,  #left df
    data_for_join, #right df
    how='inner', 
    distance_col="distance"
)
```

(Contrived) example: Join every Austin tract to its closest neighbor or neighbors. How many tracts should we expect to get?


## methods: spatial join II


```{python}
print("N tracts w closest neighbor " + 
    str(len(join_to_self)))
join_to_self[['tract_left', 'tract_right', 'distance']].head(4)
```


## common geometric operations: summary

* methods 
    * centroid computes arithmetic mean of points in the polygon
    * bounding box expands polygon in a rectangle
    * buffer expands polygon in every direction
    * dissolve combines several polygons
    * spatial join finds nearest neighbor
* do-pair-share

## do pair share

Goal: Create and plot a 500m buffer zone around the dense areas in Austin.

Steps

1. From the `dissolved` `GeoDataFrame`, get the polygon for the dense areas
2. Create a new geometry object called `geo`, which is the dense areas with a 500m buffer
3. `geo.plot()` 

After you are done, here are some cosmetic suggestions:

* Start with a grey plot of all of the Austin boundaries: `austin = data.plot(color="grey")`
* Make your buffer transparent
* Putting it all together `geo.plot(ax = austin, alpha=0.5)`
    - This plots the `geo` object with 50% transparency, on top of axes based on the `austin` object
